# Memory-Game-with-Timer

Description
The Memory Game with Timer is a JavaScript project that challenges players to test their memory skills by matching pairs of cards within a certain time limit. The game presents a grid of facedown cards, and players must flip over two cards at a time, attempting to find matching pairs. The timer adds an additional challenge by imposing a time constraint on the player's actions.


Key Features

Timer: The game includes a countdown timer that starts when the player begins the game and adds a sense of urgency to find all matching pairs within a specific time limit.

Card flipping animation: The game provides a smooth and visually appealing animation when flipping cards to reveal their faces.
